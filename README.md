# Project 2 - Chatbot using Machine Learning

## Synopsis
In this project, I have made a chatbot using machine learning, which has been trained on an "intents.json" file in order to respond to user input. It's a very simple code and chatbot due to its inability to respond to more complex input.

## What I struggled with in this project
I struggled with the modules required for the code which I had never been exposed to before, namely "colorama", "pickle", "json".

## What I learned from this project
Despite struggling a lot with them initially, I learned of the usefuleness of the aformentioned modules, particularly "pickle" and "json". "pickle" is useful because it allows me to easily transfer data. "json" is useful because it allows me to easily access, read and utilise data from other files.
